Group: Mixed Effects

1. Can you explain the concepts of posterior mean/density?

Answer: Do not focus on the Baysian perspective!

2. I have seen parametric bootstrap method appearing many times in Faraway 
book to estimate random effects, what's the diifference between this method 
and monto carlo simulation? do you suggest us to apply it in our paper?

Answer: The only difference between the parametric bootstrap and a Monte-Carlo simulation is that the parametric bootstrap uses *estimated* parameters, while a Monte-Carlo simulation uses the true  parameters.


3. We are basically thinking about an immigration model based in Germany 
which explores the relationship between the income of immigrant and factors 
that could affect it. we treat IQ, gender, the country where he/she comes 
from etc as fixed effects, his/her education level in germany and his/her 
father's social class(can be changing through time).etc as random effects, 
is this model applicable? what should we notice when constructing a brief 
and convincing model?



Aim of your project: 

1. Describe the Linear Mixed-Effects Model
2. Describe the estimation techniques (REML)
3. Describe the problems when making inference and the most common inferencial approaches.
(3.1 ?? Kenward Roger (degrees of freedoms approximation))
(3.2 ?? Parametric Bootstrap)
4. Simulation (?)
5. Application
