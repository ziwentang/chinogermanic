1, Why do we need to use Likelihood ratio test and Wald-test for inference 
instead of other testing approaches?


2, In book “Linear mixed models for longitudinal data, Verbeke, 
Molenberghs”(we call it Verbeke book later), page 56, section 6.2.1, why 
approximating the distribution of by a standard univariate normal 
distribution?
ANSWER: 
If the data is Gaussian, the statistic (\hat{\beta}_j-\beta_j)/\hat{s.e.}(\hat{\beta}_j) is t-distributed. But if the data is not Gaussian, the statistic (\hat{\beta}_j-\beta_j)/\hat{s.e.}(\hat{\beta}_j) is not t-distributed; however the statistic is Gaussian *asymptotically* as $n\to\infty$ (by the central limit theorem). In such cases approximating the distribution of the statistic by a standard univariate normal might be justified. However: Usually nobody is doing it! Since a t-distribution (and F) leads to more conservative and reliable critical values!


3, In Verbeke book, page 56, section 6.2.2, why not we skipping Wald-test 
and directly applying F-test since Wald-test has such drawback?
ANSWER: 
Yes, generally nobody uses the Wald test!


4, In Verbeke book , page 61, section 6.2.4, how to understand “A sufficient 
condition for .................with respect to model misspecification of the 
covariance structure.”?
ANSWER: 
Unbiasedness of hat{\beta} requires a correct model specification of the mean part.
Also, using (6.3) requires a correct model specification of the variance part


5,  In Verbeke book , page 63, section 6.2.5, how to understand “Indeed, the 
mean structure of the model fitted under H0 ....................which makes 
them no longer comparable.”, the similar explanation also appear in 
reml.pdf, page 4.
ANSWER: 
REML maximizes a modified likelihood that is free of mean components. Therefore, comparing the models which differ only in their mean-components is not possible using the "REML-likelihood". (only with ML)


6,  In Verbeke book , page 64, section 6.3. how to understand “and it is 
essential to obtain.............in the mean structure of the model”? what´s 
the difference between model-based inference and naive inference?
ANSWER: 
Model-based == naive 
Robust      == uses the sandwich estimator for the covariace structure


7,   In Verbeke book , page 65, section 6.3.1. What´s the difference between 
hierarchical and marginal interpretation of a linear mixed model?
ANSWER: 
Marginal:     see Eq (5.1)   y\sim N(mean, var)
hierarchical: see Eq (3.8)


8,  In Verbeke book , page 66, section 6.3.2. ML should be replaced by REML, 
does it mean ML is not applicable any more?
ANSWER: 
Still applicable but not efficient.

9,  In Verbeke book , page 69, under expression (6.13), what´s the meaning 
of “on the boundary of the parameter space”?
ANSWER: 
Restrictions such as symmetry and positive semi-definiteness of the covariance matrix lead to such "boundary"-problems.
